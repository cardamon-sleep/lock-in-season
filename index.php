                The harrowing fact is that there are countless external factors that hinder us from accomplishing our goals.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Perhaps more distressing however, is that what is often the biggest obstacle, and the only variable we control is ourselves.
                Internal factors such as procrastination, self-doubt, insecurity, and laziness stop many people from advancing towards desired outcomes. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the modern age a wall of distraction often exists between individuals and doing the work 
                required to attain a desired result. Constantly accessible entertainment and addictively-engineered services produce
                a weakened ability to focus, create dependency, and reinforce negative habits.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To <span class = "emphasis-1">lock in</span> is to be in a state of mental strength and clarity that enforces self-control, increases
                ability to focus, and naturally produces healthy behaviours. Being locked in yields better mental and physical health and facilitates productivity.
