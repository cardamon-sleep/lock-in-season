someitmes the databse tweaks, not letting me access the site, or some other
i didn't take immediate note of


[when trying to load database backed site]
Error: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1044] Access denied for user 'serveruser'@'localhost' to database 'lock_in_season'
    * solved by regranting access of server user to my database
    * entailed running the query from stungeye: https://stungeye.github.io/Web-Dev-2-Notes/docs/php/php-and-mysql/your-database-php-and-mysql.html#sql-user-administration
    * select the lock_in_season db first, then the sql tab from there

        GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER
        ON lock_in_season.* TO 'serveruser'@'localhost';

[when trying to access certain tabs of localhost phpmyadmin]
#1030 - Got error 176 "Read page with wrong checksum" from storage engine Aria



[ORDER OF WHERE YOU PUT SQL QUERIES MATTERS]
    * to avoid having to make new variables for every query on the same page to a different db
        (ex. query categories and blog_posts table on edit-article.php)
    * put query code above code that uses it
